First I start off by importing fonts to use then add in my elements in the head to a flex box and aligned the elements 
like the list and h1 accordingly.
added hover to the a tag in the list
Then I added another flex box for all the pictures displayed in cards.
played around with the margins to get good semetrical spacing between them
added a base image to all cards and played with the spacing to make the image fit the card it 
added some hover to the image and the card.
added some postion styling
added fluid typography to my font size
added three audo control panels as shown in the example and put some juice wrld in there (9994L) :)
then added the image to the under the audio
added some details in the footer
then I finally added the media query to change some of the layout depending on max width.
